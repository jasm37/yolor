train_perc: 0.75 # Percentage (<1) of the data to be used for training. The rest will be used to validation

# number of splits to divide each sequence for example:
# sequence: 1,2,3,4,...20
# num_groups: 4
# Then groups = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
num_splits: 4

# So, for example if ``train_perc`` is 0.75, ``num_groups`` is 4 and for ``cat_name`` there are two groups:
# A: [1,2,3,4,...20]
# B: [100, 101, .. 200]
# Then the training set would be [1,2,3, .. 14, 15] + [100, 101, .. 148, 149, 150]
# and the validation set would be [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] + [151, 152, 152, .. 199, 200]
