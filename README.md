# YOLOR
## This repository
This code has been adapted from the [original YOLOR repo](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolor) and 
[this YOLOv5 refactoring](https://github.com/j-marple-dev/AYolov2). Most modules were taken from the refactored 
code except for the files that involve creating the YOLOR model from its config file. This repo is totally 
experimental and is mainly meant for research purposes.   
 

## Installation
Installation is straight forward given the ```requirements.txt``` file.

## Remarks
- The file containing the module definition is not properly commented/documented and must be cleaned up
