# YOLOR
This code has been adapted from the [original YOLOR repo](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolor) and 
[this YOLOv5 refactoring](https://github.com/j-marple-dev/AYolov2). 
Most modules were taken from the refactored code except for the files that involve creating the YOLOR model 
from its config file. This repo is totally experimental and is mainly meant for research purposes.   

## Installation
Installation is straight forward given the ```requirements.txt``` file.
